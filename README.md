# uno-synth-remote-sl-template
IK Multimedia Uno Synth template for Novation Remote SL series (1st gen)

Work in progress, but may be useful to someone anyhow. Most of the front panel matrix mapped to discrete controls. ADSRs on the sliders, individual osc configuration on top left encoders, basic lfo on the remaining encoders, filter realtime controls on bottom left pots, o1/o2/noise mixer on the remaining bottom pots.
